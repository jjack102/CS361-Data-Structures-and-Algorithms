Implementing ADTs with Arrays
<br /> I worked on the Faculty class. This class is designed to represent faculty members and their associated course sections. It provides methods for managing and accessing this information. The class's private data members and some functions have specific constraints, so any derived classes or modifications should respect these constraints to ensure the class's integrity and compatibility with existing code.
