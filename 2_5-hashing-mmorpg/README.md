Implementing Hashing - Unordered multimap
<br />I worked on CellIndex and CellMap. The C++ header file defines a CellIndex struct that represents the indices of a cell in a world or grid. It also provides the necessary functions to compute the hash value of a CellIndex object and to compare two CellIndex objects for equality. Additionally, it defines a specialization for std::hash to enable hashing of CellIndex objects. The code for CellMap implements the two functions defined in the cellMap.h header file. These functions are used to record a character's position in a cell map and check if a character can see another character within a specified cell size.
