Implementing Recursion and Stacks
<br />I worked on the Balancer class. This class makes use of a stack to keep track of the opening tags encountered so far. If a mismatch is detected (e.g., a closing tag doesn't match the most recently added opening tag), the error flag is set to true, and all subsequent calls to status will return -1 to indicate an error.
