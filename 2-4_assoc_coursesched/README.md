# Implementing Maps and Sets
I worked on the Department class. This class allows you to manage faculty members and the courses they teach, using associative containers for efficient storage and retrieval. Faculty names are kept in alphabetical order to facilitate easy access and retrieval. This class can be useful for organizing and querying information about faculty and their courses within a department.
