# CS361 Data Structures and Algorithms
Course Description
<br /> Common abstract data types, including vectors, lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, heaps, and graphs. Standard C++ 
interfaces for these ADTs. Iterators and generics. Choosing data structures and algorithms to implement ADTs, via analysis of 
their time and space complexity.
