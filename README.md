# CS361 Data Structures and Algorithms
Course Description
<br /> Common abstract data types, including vectors, lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, heaps, and graphs. Standard Java 
interfaces for these ADTs. Iterators and generics. Choosing data structures and algorithms to implement ADTs, via analysis of 
their time and space complexity.
