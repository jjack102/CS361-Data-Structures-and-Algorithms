# Implementing Graphs and Queues
I worked on City.h and City.cpp. The class is designed to model a city's road network and provide functionality for querying road information, checking for potholes, and finding the fastest route while considering a pothole limit. The implementation uses Boost Graph Library to handle graph-related operations efficiently. It uses a graph data structure to represent the road network efficiently.
